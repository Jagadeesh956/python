Python shell that runs when we execute python3 on terminal is a REPL [ read , evaluate , print and loop]

So anything typed in the shell immediately prints the expected output .

Major difference between List and Strings are that latter ones are Immutable.

Planet = "MARS"

planet[0] would give you "M", but we can assign planet[0] = "P"

str.split() turns a string into a list of smaller strings, breaking on whitespace by default. This is super useful for taking you from one big string to a list of words.

Note that the empty string is also the only string that Python considers as False when converting to boolean.

1: type() (what is this thing?)
2. dir() (what can I do with it?)
3.help() (tell me more)
